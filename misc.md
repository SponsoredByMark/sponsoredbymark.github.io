## Mark\'s Most Important Rules To Live By (work in progress)

1. Say everything and anything offensive.
2. Be sarcastic. 

## Music Genres That Should Exist

* Microsymphonies: Original works of pseudo-classical music that consist of multiple movements, and fit within a reasonable 3-5 minute duration.
* Wiscodisco: Disco music made in Wisconsin. Usually contains lyrics about cheese.
* Nixonpop: A genre where the music is very uneventful and unimportant until the end when it utterly disappoints you.
