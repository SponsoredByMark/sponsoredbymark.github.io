Someone Stole My Soul
=====================

Verse 1:
Em C7 G D
She had my eyes fixated on the tunnel view.
I told the whole world of the vines that slowly grew. And
all the pressure building up did fizzle 'fore the bloom, coz
Am7
it was never all that it had seemed.

Verse 2:
Em C7 G D
She took a new shape on the day the tides did change.
But I had found the waters only stayed the same. And
I wasn't far from the lighthouse at the bay, but
Am7
it was never real, 'tis just a dream.

Chorus:
C7 G Em D
Somebody stole my soul, and put it in a
safe, and threw the key a thousand miles away. And
I'm never one to know what waits for me at sea, but
C                          Bm
someone stole my soul, and it was
Am
me.

Verse 3:
Em C7 G D
I took the early train, and never rode it home.
I let the iron flask obfuscate my dome. And
as I would carve my way, I knew not where I roam, coz
Em                   D     A7
hazy is the realm of the unknown.

Chorus:
C7 G Em D
Somebody stole my soul, and put it in a
safe, and threw the key a thousand miles away. And
I'm never one to know what waits for me at sea, but
C                          Bm
someone stole my soul, and it was
Am .. Bm7
me.
Em                         D
someone stole my soul, and it was
A
me.

[Instrumental solo to the main progression of the chorus]

Bridge:
Am9 Am9 D D
No sense of circumstance can tear the pow'rs that be. And
no sense of relevance can tilt the world I see, for
C7 G Em D
none of the waiting 'round does breed complacency, coz
C                   Bm Am               D
someone stole my soul; someone stole my soul!

Verse 4:
Em C7 G D
She took me by the hand, and told me what to know.
I stayed, facade obliged, to see where it would go. But
I'm none the wiser than the man that walks alone, for
Em                    D
I have never looked above the
A
low.

Chorus:
C7 G Em D
Somebody stole my soul, and put it in a
safe, and threw the key a thousand miles away. And
I'm never one to know what waits for me at sea, but
C                          Bm
someone stole my soul, and it was
Am .. Bm7
me.
Em                         D
someone stole my soul, and it was
A
me.
