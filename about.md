My name is Mark. "Sponsored By Mark!" is the handle under which I make things nowadays. What do I make? Lots of things. I write & record music, write blog posts and articles, and occasionally a video or podcast episode. I also enjoy talking about sociopolitical issues, mainly concerning the size/overreach of governments, ethics in technology, and a little bit of economics. Any links relevant to the things I do can be found elsewhere on this website. If you want to see this site's source code, [here ya go](https://github.com/SponsoredByMark/sponsoredbymark.github.io).
