<h3>Mark who?</h3>

<p>Mark! Silver, of course (and yes, the exclamation point is part of the name). I'm some random dude from the United State of Wiscodisco. I can be most effectively described as such:</p>

<ul>

<li>102% Musician
<li>75% Nerd
<li>96.42% Aware that the math with those percentages doesn't add up.
<li>0% Sarcastic

</ul>

<p>Get it. Got it? Good.</p>

<h3>Nice website, bruh.</h3>

<p>Ah yes, the website. 'Probably looks a little simple-stupid by today's standards, but that's by design. I want something that I can maintain on my own terms, and I don't want to put alot of time into doing so. Also, I'm no longer doing the whole "social media" thing (outside of IM, email, & music-publishing websites), so consider this website the central portal for all things related to me.</p>

<h3>Mark's Most Important Rules To Live By (work in progress)</h3>

<ol>

<li>Say everything and anything offensive.
<li>Be sarcastic.

</ol>

<h3>Music Genres That Should Exist</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Wiscodisco:</b> Disco music made in Wisconsin. Usually contains lyrics about cheese.
<li><b>Nixonpop:</b> A genre where the music is very uneventful and unimportant until the end when it utterly disappoints you.

</ul>
