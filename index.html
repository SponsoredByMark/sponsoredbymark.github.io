<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Mark! Silver (and yes, the exclamation point is part of the name). I am, among other things, a singer-songle-songwriter &amp; musician who hails from the United State of Wiscodisco. Music has always been a big part of my life, and since late 2012, I've been sharing the music I make with the world via the information superhighway known as the Internet. Nowadays, I create my tunes using open-source software on Arch Linux, &amp; release all my tunes for free &amp; under the CC-BY-4.0 license (simply put: feel free to use my music in any way you see fit, so long as your credit me for my work).</p>
<p>In late 2017, I started teaching myself how to write music in a notation editor, which is totally awesome because it allows for anyone to learn &amp; perform tunes (mainly jazz charts) that I write in this manner. As soon as I set up a legit payment method, I'll be happy to write a chart of just about any genre for you for a small commission fee. If you're at all interested, feel free to email me: <strong>mark silver media at proton mail dot com</strong></p>
