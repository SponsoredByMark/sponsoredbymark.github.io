<h3>Mark who?</h3>

<p>Mark! Silver, of course (and yes, the exclamation point is part of the name). I'm some random dude from the United State of Wiscodisco. I can be most effectively described as such:</p>

<ul>

<li>102% Musician
<li>75% Nerd
<li>96.42% Aware that the math with those percentages doesn't add up.
<li>0% Sarcastic

</ul>

<p>Get it. Got it? Good.</p>

<h3>Nice website, bruh.</h3>

<p>Ah yes, the website. 'Probably looks a little simple-stupid by today's standards, but that's by design. I want something that I can maintain on my own terms, and I don't want to put alot of time into doing so. Also, I'm no longer doing the whole "social media" thing (outside of IM, email, & music-publishing websites), so consider this website the central portal for all things related to me.</p>

<hr><h2 id="blog">Microblog</h2>

<p>This is the closest thing to twitter that you'll get out of me. :P</p>

<ul>

<li><b>21st October 2017 @ 11:03AM:</b> I'm gonna get started on writing an article that explains why I'm no longer using social media. Should I post it to social media?
<li><b>16th October 2017 @ 8:32PM:</b> Watching a few ricing videos convinced me to give the i3 window manager a try. Long story short: I'm really diggin' it, and I intend to do alot of playing around with i3 in the foreseeable 
future.
<li><b>14th October 2017 @ 8:26PM:</b> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sponsoredbyarbys/someone-stole-my-soul-stripped-demo">Here ya go, kiddies.</a>
<li><b>7th October 2017 @ 5:27PM:</b> <a href="https://searx.me/?q=marksilvermedia&categories=social+media">I guess I make ridiculous github commits sometimes...</a>
<li><b>7th October 2017 @ 5:18PM:</b> Someone needs to get ahold of the folks behind the Cuphead game, & tell them that I'll buy it & its soundtrack if they port it to Linux. Seriously.
<li><b>6th October 2017 @ 8:42PM:</b> It doesn't hurt to just binge-listen to a bunch of ska punk every once in a while. It pulls my mind out of the day-to-day craziness.
<li><b>1st October 2017 @ 7:28PM:</b> I can officially simulate an electric bass w/ my strat using one of my amp's built-in effects. Now if only there was a drum setting...
<li><b>30th September 2017 @ 9:04PM:</b> Up and running, boi!

</ol>

<h3>Music Genres That Should Exist</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Microsymphonies:</b> Original works of pseudo-classical music that consist of multiple movements, and fit within a reasonable 3-5 minute duration.
<li><b>Wiscodisco:</b> Disco music made in Wisconsin. Usually contains lyrics about cheese.
<li><b>Nixonpop:</b> A genre where the music is very uneventful and unimportant until the end when it utterly disappoints you.
