<p>So, I kinda sit in my own little bubble here on the Internet. Social media isn't exactly something I'm keen on being part of for <a href="articles/sockit.html">reasons that I may have mentioned before</a>. That being said however, there are still ways you can get ahold of me.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>My email address is probably the communication method that I check the most, &amp; is therefore the easiest way to reach me. I don't have a strict policy along the lines of &quot;business inquiries only&quot; or whatever, but just try to be a reasonable human, yo: <strong>mark silver media at proton mail dot com</strong></p>
<h2 id="xmpp">XMPP</h2>
<p>I've got two of these actually, &amp; check both of them via <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>. If you happen to have an XMPP address, feel free to hit me up via either of mine:</p>

<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>
<p>I'm a little reluctant to be using the service because I disagree with some of their practices. Nonetheless, feel free to contact me via this service if you want to: <strong>Mark! #6916</strong></p>
