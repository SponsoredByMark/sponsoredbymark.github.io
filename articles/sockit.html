<h1>Why I Left Social Media (And Why You Should Too)</h1>

I'm not gonna lie here: There is definitely a certain value to interacting with people online. Seriously, some of the coolest people I've ever talked to came into contact with me via the Internet. Today however, I'm going to make an anecdotal case for why social media is not the way to do it.

<h2>What is social media exactly?</h2>

There are of course many ways to be social on the information superhighway, and I suppose that some of the services that I still use could for whatever intent or purpose be classified as social media. For the sake of this article, however, let's consider "social media" to be any website/service that is or operates similarly to Facebook or Twitter; a platform where one can maintain a sort of microblog with constant status updates that can be accessed publicly by anyone else on the website. That's a huge oversimplification of the functionality of such services, but if you're familiar with how Facebook or Twitter operate, you have a better idea of it than I can articulate.

<h2>Have you ever done drugs?</h2>

It's common knowledge that the consumption of certain drugs & substances (tobacco, cocaine, alcohol, coffee, etc.) can lead to a certain dependency on such things that isn't exactly healthy in the long term. I bring this up because social media can act in a very similar way. We're all prone to checking how many likes, comments, and/or follows we have received in response to statuses we post, and this practice can form a sort of addiction of its own. Seeing that someone has liked one of your posts provides you with a certain sense of instant gratification that makes you keep coming back. Seriously, how many times per day do you find yourself checking social media to see if you've gotten any new interactions on your posts? Don't lie to me. I know it's more than once.

<h2>I hate marketing.</h2>

I took a marketing class when I was a sophomore in high school, and hated it. I won't get into why, but I just wanted to share that real quick. If I know a thing about marketing though, it's that the smartest way to get yourself out there is to target the markets that will be the most receptive to you. I probably didn't need a marketing class to teach me that though. But anyways, one of the arguments I hear in favor of social media is that it's a good way to market yourself, simply because most people are on social media. Ok. Let's do a little thought experiment, shall we? Let's say that I release a new song, and want feedback on it. Would it be easier for me to get feedback from a generic but large pool of users, who would have to do a lot of sorting/searching to even find my post, or from a forum of fellow musicians, where my post would be easy to find, & would be answered by people who share my interests? I think you know the answer, but I'll write it out for you: I'd much rather be a part of a smaller community of people with similar interests, as opposed to a network mostly consisting of people who don't, as the former would better allow for me to form friendships, community, and connections with interesting people. Heck, nearly every one of my online-friends in my instant-messaging repertoire are friends with me because of a mutual membership on a forum I used to post on.

<h2>WAAAAH. MUH POLITICS.</h2>

Tying politics to a form of online service that was once meant for making friendships online... what could possibly go wrong? The thing about most of the political "discourse" that has been going on social media is the fact that it isn't as much that as it is just constant bickering. Seriously. People who probably would get along in any other context have let their differences divide them, which has allowed a certain ad-hominem-centric environment to permeate most every social media platform. Dehumanizing people on a basis of politics is petty as all hell, and I don't want to add fire to the flame. If you want to talk politics with me, lets have a discussion - not a fight.

<h2>Need I continue?</h2>

No, but I oughtta wrap it up somewhere. Long story short, social media is not really something that I want/need to have in my life, so I've stopped using it. If you're finding this article through a post of mine on a social media account, it means I've left that site, but you can find ways to contact me <a href="http://sponsoredbymark.github.io/">on my website</a> if you wanted to get ahold of me for whatever reason. I'll still be around on the internet uploading music, posting in forums, instant messaging, podcasting, & nerding about, but social media is the aspect of my internet experience that I'm phasing out now. Cheers, y'all.
