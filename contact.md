# Contact - Sponsored By Mark!

So, I kinda sit in my own little bubble here on the Internet. Social media isn\'t exactly something I\'m keen on being part of for [reasons that I may have mentioned before](articles/sockit.html). That being said however, there are still ways you can get ahold of me.

## Email

My email address is probably the communication method that I check the most, &amp; is therefore the easiest way to reach me. I don\'t have a strict policy along the lines of \"business inquiries only\" or whatever, but just try to be a reasonable human, yo: **mark silver media at proton mail dot com**

## XMPP

I\'ve got two of these actually, &amp; check both of them via [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/). If you happen to have an XMPP address, feel free to hit me up via either of mine:

* **sponsored by mark at join diaspora dot com**
* **mark silver media at jwchat dot org**

## Discord

I\'m a little reluctant to be using the service because I disagree with some of their practices. Nonetheless, feel free to contact me via this service if you want to: **Mark! #6916**
