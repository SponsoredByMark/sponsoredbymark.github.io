Every so often, I get stubborn or bored or something and I decide to change my personal branding name a bit. This is one such instance. For a few of my smaller projects & some social media accounts, I've been utilizing the moniker of "SponsoredByMark". Why? I can't remember. But it's a moniker that has more potential to become a unique identifier for my content than my pseudonym alone, so I'm sticking with it full time. What's changing as a result of this? Not much actually. I left most usernames for my social media the way they were, "Sponsored By Mark!" is now the "full/real name" on the page. However, I intend to discontinue my use on most of these social networks (but more on that in a future post). Also, I intend to rework the "Groovy Galleon" brand at some point next month as to fit within the direction I'm looking to take it in. It's gonna be slick, but it'll take some serious work on my part. In the meantime, expect me to post daily on this here website for the foreseeable future.
